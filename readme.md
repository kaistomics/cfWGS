## Description
Multi-cancer early detection remains a key challenge in cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based liquid biopsy. Here, we performed cfDNA whole-genome sequencing to generate two test datasets covering 2,543 patient samples of 9 cancer types and 1,241 normal control samples, and also a reference dataset for background variant filtering based on 20,529 low-depth healthy samples. An external cfDNA dataset consisting of 208 cancer and 214 normal control samples was used for additional evaluation. Unprecedented accuracy for cancer detection and tissue-of-origin localization is achieved using our algorithm, which incorporates cancer type-specific profiles of mutation distribution and chromatin organization in tumor tissues as model references. Remarkably, our integrative model detects early-stage cancers, including those of pancreatic origin, with high sensitivity that is comparable to that of late- stage detection. Model interpretation reveals the contribution of the cancer type- specific genomic and epigenomic features. Our methodologies may lay the groundwork for accurate cfDNA-based cancer diagnosis, especially at early stages.

## System requirements
#### Hardware requirements
Training the genome, epigenome model require sufficient RAM and GPU acceleration. We trained our model using following specs:

RAM: 378GB
CPU: 56 cores
GPU: NVIDIA Titan Xp

#### Software requirements
The genome and epigenome model were trained on Linux operating system (Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS).
We recommend to use miniconda to install the required packages in the virtual environment (https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh).
We trained out model in the virtual environment with python version 3.8.12

## Demo
Constructing genome model for cancer detection and TOO prediction.
Argument 1: input file localization
Argument 2: hyperparameter searching trial (we set this value to 200 in the paper).
Argument 3: GPU number  
~~~
python model_genome.cancer_detection.py ./data/input_genome.cancer_detection.npz 11 1

## Results
When training is completed, final output model is created in TensorFlow SavedModel format(h5 format), which stores the model structure and weight at once.
